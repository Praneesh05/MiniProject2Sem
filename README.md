This hypothetical dataset contains information about diabetic patients, including patient ID, age, gender, BMI, blood sugar levels, and whether they are taking medication. The visual representations (bar graph, histogram, scatter plot) provide insights into the distribution of gender, age, and the relationship between BMI and blood sugar levels among these patients.
